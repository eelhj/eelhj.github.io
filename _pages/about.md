<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [University of Minnesota (UMN), Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/).

Prior to this, I received my MS and BS in Computing Science from [Simon Fraser University (SFU)](https://www.sfu.ca/), and a BS in Materials Science & Engineering from [Korea University](https://www.korea.edu/mbshome/mbs/en/index.do).

My research interest lies in machine learning, specifically in creating solutions that are generalizable and transferable to interdisciplinary domains.

<span style="color:red"> **I'm always open to collaboration on AI, ML, computer vision, data science or HCI projects. Feel free to email me!** </span> **Additionally, if you are a student at UMN looking to start research, you are more than welcome to contact me üôÇ**
