<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [University]().

Prior to this, I received my MS and BS in Computing Science from [Simon Fraser University (SFU)](https://www.sfu.ca/), and a BS in Materials Science & Engineering from [Korea University](https://www.korea.edu/mbshome/mbs/en/index.do).

My research interest lies in machine learning, specifically in creating solutions that are generalizable to different domains, including human-computer interaction (HCI).

<span style="color:red"> **I am actively looking for research internships (Summer 2025)!** </span>
